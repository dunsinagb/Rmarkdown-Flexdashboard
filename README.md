https://rpubs.com/Dunsinagb/925603

Introduction

This code through looks into ways to make it simple to create interactive dashboards for R by combining R Markdown and flexdashboard

**Content Overview**

 A dashboard combines data and visualizations which helps in decision making. In this tutorial, we will generate a dashboard using R Markdown.  Our focus will be on the following,

**Why You Should Care**

The numerous benefit of R markdown makes it very important to learn. Some of the benefits include;
-Readable by humans
-Syntax is simple.
-Simple to Change
-Adaptable Export formats
-Simple to distribute

**Learning Objectives**

You will be able to do the following at the end of this activity:

-List the advantages of creating reports with R Markdown.
-Describe how R Markdown is useful in Open Science approaches.
-Describe how R Markdown can help your research.

**Code Chunk**

Code chunks are formed by three back-ticks and curly brackets containing a lowercase "r." Three back-ticks close the chunk. You can insert a new chunk by typing it, using the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + Alt + I (or Cmd + Shift + r in Mac), or by clicking the green 'insert a new code chunk' icon at the top of your script editor.
An R Markdown script can have multiple code "chunks" - these are sections of the script where you can write multiple-line R code and function similarly to mini R scripts.

**Further Exposition**

You can write narrative text outside of an R code "chunk." You can italicize text by surrounding it with one asterisk (*), or bold text by surrounding it with two asterisks (**), as described on the Reports with R Markdown page. Remember that bullets and numbering schemes are affected by newlines, indentation, and using two spaces at the end of a line.
